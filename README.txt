Description: 
    I have 3 disc golf putters; the Dagger, the Luna, and the Caltrop.
    The main goals of this experiment were to see if I perform better
    with one putter than the others and to see if my overall putting
    rate improved over time. All putts were taken in my basement from
    25 feet away from the basket. 

Experimental procedure:
    First, the order to throw each of the 3 putters in is randomized.
    This way the results aren't affected by the order I throw in (I
    hypothesized that my first of the 3 throws would tend to be worse).
    Then after recording which putts were made, this process is repeated 
    10 times for a total of 30 throws. This is repeated for 10 days, 
    giving a total of 300 putts at the conclusion of the experiment. 

Results:
        Daily_Rate.pdf contains the overall rate of made putts each day. 
    There appears to be an upward trend, though the rate is not strictly increasing. 
        Order_Rate.pdf contains 95% confidence intervals for the actual
    proportion of putts made when thrown 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in the putting
    order. Even though the proprtion of putts made on the 1st throw was
    lower than the others, there's a lot of overlap in the confidence 
    intervals so I can't confidently confirm my hypothesis that the first
    throw is worse. 
        Putter_Rate.pdf contains 95% confidence intervals for the actual
    proportion of putts made by each putter. These results surprised me a 
    bit- instead of showing one putter that was better than the others, it
    appears to show that the Dagger and Caltrop have about the same success rate
    while the Luna appears to be worse. This surprised me since I almost never
    putt with the Caltrop but have bounced back and forth between the 
    Dagger and Luna a lot.
        I also ran a 2 proprtion z test to see if the proportion of made Luna
    putts was less than the proportion of made Dagger and Caltrop putts (combined).
    This gave me a P-value of 0.02261, so I'm pretty confident that the Luna
    performs statistically worse for me than my other putters. 

Conclusions:
        The first big takaway is that practicing putting seems to work. I think 
    I'd need to continue this experiment for longer to see how much it's actually
    helping, but in 10 days it appears as if theres an upward trend (Also, I'm 
    subjectively feeling much more confident with my putting). 
        The second big takaway is that I am statistically worse at putting with
    my Luna than my other putters. I am going to stop using this disc
    entirely and start using the Dagger and Caltrop as my main putters. 

Further Questions:
    How 'streaky' am I? (Do several makes/misses in a row affect the 
    pobability of making the next one?)

    How does my putting performance vary over the day? Am I more likely
    to make the last set of 3 putts than the first set of 3 putts?

    Are these results consistent with distances other than 25 feet?

    How applicable is this setting (My basement with a cheap basket) to a real disc golf course?
